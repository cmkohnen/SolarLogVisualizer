# SolarLogVisualizer
Hello Everyone!
Thank you vor visiting my small little project.

This project (Java) is about visualizing your Data stored in the Solarlog-Backup files. As of right now the project is working, but lots of Work is still needed to be done. 



As of right now you can import as many Data files as you like (and your computer can handle) and save them into a special file, for more information read the wiki.
You are also able to visualize (just) one graph based on a day in the Format YEAR/MONTH/DAY without the "/".


If you would like to help or add anything you would find necessary feel free to open a pull request or contact me. You can also suggest features in the comment section.
